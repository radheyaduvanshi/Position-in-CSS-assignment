Absolute Positioning:
When you apply absolute positioning to an element, it is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, 
usually an element with a position property set to relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky.
If there is no positioned ancestor, the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block, which is
typically the viewport or the top-level <html> element.Elements with absolute positioning are taken out of the normal 
document flow, which means they do not affect the layout of other elements on the page.

Relative Positioning:
Relative positioning is used to adjust the position of an element relative to its normal position in the document flow.
When you apply relative positioning to an element, it remains in the document flow, and its position can be adjusted using
properties like top, right, bottom, and left. These properties are used to specify the offset from the element's normal position.
Unlike absolute positioning, other elements on the page are aware of the space occupied by elements with relative positioning.
